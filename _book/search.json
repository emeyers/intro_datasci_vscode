    "text": "1.1 What is Data Science?\nIn this chapter we will discuss what the field of Data Science is, and give a brief history of how the field developed.\nThis book is your guide to understanding the exciting and increasingly influential field of data science. Whether you’re curious about how data shapes our world or are looking to explore the possibilities of data-driven insights, this book will provide you with a foundational understanding of what data science is and why it matters.\nData science is a dynamic and interdisciplinary field that combines techniques and theories from statistics, computer science, and specialized knowledge in various areas to extract valuable knowledge and insights from data [Chapter 1]. This data can come in many forms, whether neatly organized in databases or existing as unstructured information like text or images.\nAt its core, data science follows a systematic process for analyzing data. This includes a range of crucial steps, starting with data collection and ensuring the data is in a usable state through data cleaning. Once prepared, the data is explored to uncover initial patterns and relationships (data exploration). Data scientists then apply various modeling techniques to identify deeper insights, which need to be carefully interpreted to draw meaningful conclusions. Finally, the findings are communicated effectively to inform decisions and understanding [Chapter 1].\nThe field of data science has experienced remarkable growth in recent years This surge in prominence can be attributed to several key factors: - The explosion in the amount of data being generated across all sectors, from social media to scientific research. - Significant advancements in computing power, enabling the processing and analysis of these vast datasets. - The development of increasingly sophisticated analytical tools and techniques that allow for more complex and insightful data exploration.\nBy delving into data science, you can gain practical analytical skills that are applicable across a wide array of fields [Chapter 1, 62]. You’ll learn how to approach real-world data, identify key questions, and use data-driven methods to find answers and understand the world around us [Chapter 1, 62]. As a lighthearted starting point, you might hear the quip that “A Data Scientist is a Statistician who lives in San Francisco” [Chapter 1, 11]. While humorous, this simple definition hints at the combination of statistical thinking with the technological innovation often associated with data science. Throughout this book, we will move beyond simplistic definitions to explore the rich and multifaceted nature of this vital field.\nKey points - Despite the fact that humans have been collecting data for millenia, and doing sophisticated analyses of data for centuries, the field of data science” (or at least the name) is relatively new. -",

    "text": "2.1.1 Expressions\nA Python expression is any piece of code that produces a value.. For example, the following is an expression that simply creates the number 21.\n\n21\n\n21\n\n\nSimilarly, an expression could be a series of mathematical operations that evaluate to number. For example, if want want to add 5 plus 2 and then multiple the result by 6 we can write:\n\n6 * (5 + 2) \n\n42\n\n\nAs mentioned above, the defining features of a python expression is that it produces a value. Expressions are one of the fundamental building blocks of data analysis and they will appear frequently throughout this book.\n\n\n2.1.2 Syntax\nSyntax is the set of rules that defines how Python code must be written. One that think of syntax as the grammar of the Python programming language. In order for Python to be able to run your code, it must use the correct syntax. If incorrect syntax is used, then one will get a “syntax error”, and the code will not run.\nTo illustrate this, let’s calculate the value of 3 squared (\\(8^2\\)) which hopefully you remember is equal to the value of 64. In Python, if we want to take a value x to the power y (i.e., to calculate \\(x^y\\)) we use the syntax x**y. So, if we wanted to calculate \\(8^2\\) we would write the following Python code:\n\n8**2\n\n64\n\n\nSince we have written the correct syntax, the code runs and the result of 64 is calculated as expected.\nHowever, if we accidentially put an extra space between the two * symbols, Python will not know how to interpret the expression and we will get a syntax error as shown below:\n\n8* *2\n\n\n  Cell In[4], line 1\n    8* *2\n       ^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\n\n\n\nWe there is a syntax error, Python will print out SyntaxError and give you an indication where the syntax error has occurred using a ^ symbol. As we can see here, Python is trying to show that the syntax error has occurred due to the extra space between the * symbols.\nThe ability to be able to spot and fix syntax errors is a fundamental skill you will develop as become proficient in analyzing data in Python.\n\n\n2.1.3 Statements\nA Python statement is a line of code that performs an action; i.e., it tells Python that it should do something other than just calculating a value.\nOne of the most fundamental statement types is an assignment statement, where we have Python store a value in a named variable. For example, the following code assigns the value 10 to the variable a:\n\na = 10\n\nWe can then refer back to the variable a later in our code to retrive the stored value. For example, if we just write a on a line by itself, it will print out the value stored in a.\n\na\n\n10\n\n\nAs we can see, the value printed out is 10 which is the value we had previously stored in the name a.\nIf we then assigne the name a to another value, it will overwrite the previously stored value and a will store the new value.\n\na = 21\na\n\n21\n\n\nWe an also do mathematical operations on values stored in variables, such as adding and multiplying variables together. For example, we can assign the variable h to store the value 24, and the variable d to store the value 7, and then we can multiple these together and store the result in the variable t.\n\nh = 24\nd = 7\nt = h * d\nt\n\n168\n\n\n\n2.1.3.1 Variable names\nMust start with a character Should be meaningful name (a bad variable name).\nThe first is a law (syntax error). The second is good style to make code readible (like wearing sweatpants to class).\n\nhours = 24\ndays = 7\ntotal_hours_in_a_week = hours * days\ntotal_hours_in_a_week\n\n168\n\n\nExercise: Calculate CT yearly wage if making minimum wage…\nSo far we have only described “assignment statements”. However, later in this book will see many other types of statements, such as “for loops” and “conditional statements” which us to do more complex processing in Python.\n\n\n\n2.1.4 The difference between expressions and statements\nIf Python can evaluate it to a value, it’s an expression. If it’s doing something (like a loop, a function definition, or an assignment), it’s a statement.\nSo, 2 + 2 is an expression, but x = 2 + 2 is a statement that contains an expression.\n\nx = 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm\nDescription\nExample\n\n\n\n\nExpression\nReturns a value\n2 + 2\n\n\nStatement\nPerforms an action (e.g., assignment, loop, etc.)\nx = 2 + 2",
