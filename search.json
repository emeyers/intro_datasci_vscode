(2019), have proposed that there are two main magma reservoirs feeding the Cumbre Vieja volcano; one in the mantle (30-40km depth) which charges and in turn feeds a shallower crustal reservoir (10-20km depth).\nEight eruptions have been recorded since the late 1400s (Figure 2.1).\nData and methods are discussed in Section 2.1.\nLet \\(x\\) denote the number of eruptions in a year. Then, \\(x\\) can be modeled by a Poisson distribution\n\\[\np(x) = \\frac{e^{-\\lambda} \\lambda^{x}}{x !}\n\\tag{2.1}\\]\nwhere \\(\\lambda\\) is the rate of eruptions per year. Using Equation 2.1, the probability of an eruption in the next \\(t\\) years can be calculated.\nTable 2.1 summarises the eruptions recorded since the colonization of the islands by Europeans in the late 1400s.\nHere is a cover image of the book genderated by chatGPT (Figure 1).\nFigure 2.2 shows the location of recent Earthquakes on La Palma.",
